# ToDoList
# General Introduction
It includes all basic functions of a reminder app. In this app, it has three pages, one for adding todo list, one for showing tasks with alarm clock (specifc time), and one for checking finished tasks.

In the first page, You can add your to-do-list to the local database. (For each todo: title is required, content/alarm clock are optional) And this page only shows todo unfinished.
And all the todo with an clock-setting will also be shown under the "reminding" page(second page) in addition to the first page. (as long as it's not finished)
Once you finish a task, you can mark it as 'done'. And you can check it under the tabBar 'Finished'(third page). 


Other functions:
You can also rank the priority of them in any page. 
And I am still working on it and trying to add a weather broadcast function for it.
