# ToDoList
It includes all basic functions of a reminder app. In this app, it has three pages, one for adding todo list, one for showing tasks with alarm clock (specifc time), and one for checking finished tasks.

In the first page, You can add your to-do-list to the local database. (For each todo: title is required, content/alarm clock are optional)
Once you finish the task, you can mark it as 'done'. 
And all the todo with an clocksetting will also be shown under the "reminding" page.
